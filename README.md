[Python Project Template Cookiecutter](https://github.com/at-gmbh/at-python-template)
* A project template helps with standardization and is a great way of spreading best practices
* There are many templates out there, but AT decided to build their own and manage it as an open-source project

[Vaex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELtjRdPT8is) vs. [Dask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnndxbr_Xq4)
* [Twitter Discussion and Benchmarks](https://twitter.com/twiecki/status/1296473192555577344)
* Both have impressive demos and huge potential as easy-to-use alternatives to Pandas when the data gets to large to be processed in-memory
* Dask is more deeply grounded in the PyData ecosystem, but Vaex offers some very intriguing features and apparently great performance
* **Next steps: Try both, Dask and Vaex on a real problem and compare performance and ease-of-use**
